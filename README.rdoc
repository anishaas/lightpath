<h3>About Lightpath</h3>

Lightpath focuses on concept mastery and knowledge retention for students. By tracking and recording "lightbulb moments"
(when the concept "clicks" with a student), students can revisit past material and efficiently solidify past concepts.
As a student interacts with course material, he/she creates lightbulb moments for assignments and lessons, creating a "lightpath"
guiding the student through the course material.

A) Concisely summarizing the concept is his/her own words
B) Linking videos, articles, or other resources that brought on the "lightbulb moment" for easy future reference

As a student and as a frequent tutor, I realize that the ability to summarize a concept concisely is one of the best
indications of learning. Revisiting one's own words -- one's own "lightbulb moment" -- can instantly reconnect a student
with previous material. Additionally, it is essential to pinpoint resources that clarify concepts according to one's unique
learning style. When such resources are found, they should be available for immediate access in the future.

Progressing through a course, the student records a lightbulb for each concept. Eventually, an entire path of "lightbulb moments" is established.
At that point, the student can revisit past lightbulb moments and solidify understanding without rereading entire chapters or redoing all
course assignments.

Receiving, processing, and internalizing large amounts of information is overwhelming.
My proposed application will "illuminate" this path to mastery.
